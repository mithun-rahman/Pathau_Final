# REST-API
I could solve the first phase of this problem before the time given and I aslo solved first part of the second phase and 40% of second part.

My Idea:
I create a new for table for the tags with id and expiry.For GET /users?tags=<tag1>,<tag2> this part I found out all the users id accroding to the tag list and make it as a set then I got onlu the unique id.
After that based on those id I could find user name and taglist.

I tried hard since last week. I never gave up, but finally I could find the right implementation.
It gives me a lot confindence.
